# Description
This library permits to control hobby-grade servo motors with ESP32 SoC (esp-idf) using ledc API


# Getting Started
<b>NOTE: this code is not (yet) Production Ready.</b>  
You can use this library as a component for your project:  
```
mkdir -p <YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT>/components/
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT>/components/
git clone https://github.com/ShellAddicted/ESP32SimpleServo.git
```
and see [examples/](https://github.com/ShellAddicted/ESP32SimpleServo/tree/master/examples)
